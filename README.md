# 🧠 Customer Personality Segmentation using K-Medoids and Random Forest for Determining Marketing Strategies

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **segmenting customers based on personality traits** to help determine effective **marketing strategies**.  
The segmentation process was carried out using **K-Medoids clustering** to group similar customers, and **Random Forest classification** to identify key factors influencing each segment.

This project was conducted collaboratively during college and has been **published in the proceedings of a national seminar**.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Problem Analysis & Understanding**  
   Define the business problem and identify key variables relevant to customer segmentation.

2. **Data Analysis & Exploration (EDA)**  
   Explore and visualize the data to understand distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Remove duplicates  
   - Normalize numerical features  
   - Encode categorical variables  

4. **Modeling**
   - Apply **K-Medoids clustering** to segment customers into groups with similar characteristics.  
   - Use **Random Forest** to classify data and identify the most influential features in each cluster.

5. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   Analyze each cluster’s characteristics and derive possible **marketing strategies** tailored to each customer segment.
